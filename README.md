# Pure mathematics in Lean

This is an interactive pure mathematics text book for beginning undergraduate / curious high school students. The focus of this book is on developing reasoning concerning the action of theorems on goals. The first chapter develops simple algebraic ideas in the ring of integers.

This book is part of the [exlean](https://exlean.org) project.

The code base comes from the [Natural Number Game](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) (by Kevin Buzzard, Mohammad Pedramfar and contributors from the Lean community).
