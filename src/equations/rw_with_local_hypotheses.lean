## Level 3: Rewriting with hypotheses

Look at the theorem below. It seems that you're being asked to prove `x + y = x + 2 * x`.
Surely that isn't true in general! What's
going on? If you look carefully, you'll see an additional hypothesis, `h : y = 2 * x`.

The `:` is just notation for naming a hypothesis (also called an assumption).
So the statement of the theorem can be read:

> Let `x` and `y` be integers. Let `h` be the hypothesis `y = 2 * x`. Then `x + y = x + 2 * x`.

When you start the proof, you'll note in the top-right pane that `h : y = 2 * x` has been
added to the context.

You can use the hypothesis to rewrite the goal by typing `rw h` much as you used `rw add_comm`
to rewrite via the theorem `add_comm`.

**Before doing the problem below**, think about what effect `rw h` will have on the goal.

## Translation to a hand-written proof

> Rewriting using `h`, the goal is to prove `x + 2 * x = x + 2 * x`.
> This follows by reflexivity.
