There are 5 rooms. Rooms are called 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, with 0 being
where you start and 4 being the exit.


Use `n`, `s`, `e`, `w` to move around. When you're at the exit, type `out`.

  Don't forget the commas.
  Don't bang into the walls -- those are errors.
  When you get to room 4, the tactic to get you out is `out`. 
  There is also a magic word, rumoured to be
  an ancient translation of the word `sorry`.
