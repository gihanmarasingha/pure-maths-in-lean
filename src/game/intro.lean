# Pure mathematics with Lean, version 1.0.0

## By Gihan Marasingha

This is an interactive book aimed at beginning mathematics undergraduates. You'll learn to prove
theorems online using a computer tool called Lean.

At every stage in a theorem, there is a *target*, the thing you want to prove, and a *context*, the
set of things you have already proved or assumed at the beginning of your argument.
The target and context change through the proof.

The word *goal* is used to refer variously to the target or to the combination of target and context.

You'll use *tactics* to modify the goal until you have proved the target (called 'closing the goal').
Each tactic may invoke one or more *theorems*.
